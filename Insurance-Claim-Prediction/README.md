### Project Overview

 We have a dataset thet contains the details of Policy Holder like, Age,Sex,BMI,Children,Smoking status,Charges etc.
on the basis of data given we have to make a logistic model that would predict whether a person should get claim or not.



### Learnings from the project

 Learned more methods of data visualisation,perfromance metrix of Logistic regression.


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 I checked for Outliers first, there were few outliers in BMI but did not remove them as the person with higher BMI will go for the policy for sure. Found correlation between the variables and removed few variables which were hghly correlated. Used GridSearch concept in the Logistic regression model and then found various performance metrices.
